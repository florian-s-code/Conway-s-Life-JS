A basic implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in HTML5, click on the canvas to trigger cells. Activate the calculation by setting the timer with the below form (and stop it before drawing or you'll see nothing). You can change the dimension of the canvas with the second form. 

Still need some work (a lot of optimisation). Known annoying issue : mouse position after scrolling is wrong, scroll back to the top of the page to fix.
